# React-Redux-Notes

This is a simple React App that uses React-Redux to manage the state and React Bootstrap for styling. As well, it performs basic CRUD operations with a Node JS server that updates a MySQL database of notes. <br />

## Getting started

To install all the modules and start the development server: <br />
```
npm i
npm start
```
If you wish to interact with a Node JS Server, follow the link below. You will need to setup your own database connection information in the server code.
